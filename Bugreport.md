### 1. Bug Report

Describe the six bugs:

* What happened?
* Why did it happen?
* How did you fix it?

A few lines per bug are sufficient.

## Bug 1

* What happened?

The program crashed with an IndexOutOfRangeException when loading the shopping list from the file.

* Why did it happen?

The Load() method assumed that every line contained two values separated by a semicolon. An empty line produced an array with only one element, so accessing parts[1] caused an IndexOutOfRangeException.

The most likely cause of the IndexOutOfRangeException is that parts[1] is accessed without first verifying that the array contains at least two elements.

* How did you fix it?

I added validation to skip empty lines and verify that each line contains exactly two fields before accessing parts[1]. I also replaced int.Parse() with int.TryParse() to handle invalid numeric values safely.

## Bug 2

* What happened?

After fixing the first bug, I see that the total amount is wrong.

* Why did it happen?

The loop starts at index 1 instead of 0, causing the first item in the list to be excluded from the total calculation.

for (int i = 1; i < items.Count; i++)

This is likely the defect referred to in the assignment as "produces an incorrect result without causing the program to crash."

public int Total()
    {
        int sum = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i < items.Count; i++)
        {
            sum += items[i].Price;
        }

        return sum;
    }

* How did you fix it?

Start to count from 0.

for (int i = 0; i < items.Count; i++)

## Bug 3

* What happened?

The Save() method appends an extra line break at the end of the file:

File.WriteAllText(path, string.Join("\r\n", lines) + "\r\n");

This creates an empty line at the end of the file. When the file is loaded, the empty line is split and processed as data, causing an IndexOutOfRangeException.

* Why did it happen?

The Save() method appends an extra line break ("\r\n") after the last item. This creates an empty line at the end of the file, which is later processed by Load() as if it were an item.

* How did you fix it?

I fixed the issue by removing the unnecessary trailing line break:

File.WriteAllText(path, string.Join("\r\n", lines));

I also have the validation in Load from the first bug fix to skip empty lines and malformed records.

## Bug 4

* What happened?

The program displayed the message:

Console.WriteLine("Listan är sparad.");

even when the file was not successfully saved.

* Why did it happen?

The Save() method contains an empty catch block:

try
{
    File.WriteAllText(path, string.Join("\r\n", lines));
}
catch
{
}

This catches and suppresses all exceptions without reporting them. As a result, if an error occurs during the save operation (for example, an invalid path, missing directory, or insufficient permissions), the exception is ignored and the program continues execution.

The user is then shown the message:

Console.WriteLine("Listan är sparad.");

which incorrectly indicates that the save operation was successful.

* How did you fix it?

I replaced the empty catch block with handlers for IOException and UnauthorizedAccessException. If saving fails, the program now displays an error message instead of hiding the problem. The success message is shown only after the file has been written successfully.

## Bug 5

* What happened?

I got an ArgumentOutOfRangeException when trying to remove an item that was not in the list.

Unhandled exception. System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException: Index was out of range. Must be non-negative and less than the size of the collection. (Parameter 'index')
   at System.Collections.Generic.List`1.RemoveAt(Int32 index)
   at ShoppingList.RemoveAt(Int32 number) in C:\Users\Sofia\OneDrive\Dokument\Repository\kk2-robust-shopping-list\ShoppingList.cs:line 20
   at Program.<Main>$(String[] args) in C:\Users\Sofia\OneDrive\Dokument\Repository\kk2-robust-shopping-list\Program.cs:line 30

* Why did it happen?

The problem is that RemoveAt() assumes the user always enters a valid number.

* How did you fix it?

public void RemoveAt(int number)
{
    if (number < 1 || number > items.Count)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Please enter a valid item number.");
        return;
    }

    items.RemoveAt(number - 1);
}
